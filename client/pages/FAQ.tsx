      question: "How can I create an account?",
      answer: "Creating an account is simple and free! Click the 'Sign Up' button, provide your email address, create a secure password, and verify your email. You'll also need to add your MTN Mobile Money number for payments. The entire process takes less than 2 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my phone number not accepted?",
      answer: "We currently only accept MTN Mobile Money numbers for payments as it's the most reliable payment method in Rwanda. Make sure your number is in the correct format (07XXXXXXXX) and that you have an active MTN Mobile Money account. If you're still having issues, contact our support team."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I forget my password?",
      answer: "No worries! Click on 'Forgot Password' on the login page, enter your registered email address, and we'll send you a password reset link. Check your email (including spam folder) and follow the instructions to create a new password."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I change my password?",
      answer: "To change your password: 1) Go to your profile page, 2) Navigate to the Security section, 3) Click 'Change Password', 4) Enter your current password and your new password, 5) Confirm the changes. Your new password will be active immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "Why am I not receiving any survey invitations?",
      answer: "Survey availability depends on several factors: your profile completeness, demographic match, and current survey demand. Make sure your profile is 100% complete with accurate information. Survey groups are distributed throughout the day, so check back regularly. High-quality responses to previous surveys also increase your invitation frequency."
    },
    {
      question: "Why am I not qualified for a survey group?",
      answer: "Survey groups target specific demographics to ensure relevant responses. If you're not qualified, it means the survey is looking for participants with different characteristics (age, location, interests, etc.). Don't worry - new survey groups become available daily, and you'll qualify for many others."
    },
    {
      question: "Why did I get an invitation for a closed survey group?",
      answer: "Survey groups have limited participant slots and may fill up quickly. If you received an invitation but the survey is closed, it means all available spots were taken. Keep your notifications on and respond to invitations promptly to increase your chances of participation."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does a survey group take a different amount of time than indicated?",
      answer: "Survey group timing can vary based on how thoroughly you read questions and explanations. We provide estimated completion times, but thoughtful responses (which we encourage!) may take longer. Remember, quality answers are more valuable than speed - take the time you need to provide genuine responses."
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't I continue the survey group if I accidentally exit?",
      answer: "For data integrity and fair compensation, survey groups must be completed in one session. If you accidentally exit, the session expires to prevent incomplete or inconsistent responses. Each participant gets fresh survey groups, so you'll receive new opportunities soon."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my balance the same after completing the survey group?",
      answer: "If your balance hasn't updated after completing a survey group, please wait a few minutes as updates can take time. Ensure you clicked 'Submit' on the final question. If your balance still hasn't updated after 10 minutes, contact our support team with details of the survey group you completed."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I check my balance?",
      answer: "Your current coin balance is always visible in the header of every page when you're logged in. You can also visit your Wallet page for detailed earning history, withdrawal options, and transaction records. Your balance updates in real-time after each completed survey group."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I withdraw my money?",
      answer: "Withdrawals are processed once per day via MTN Mobile Money. Go to your Wallet page, ensure you've reached the minimum payout threshold (100 coins), enter your MTN number, and request withdrawal. Payments are processed daily and should reach your account within a few hours."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for money to be transferred?",
      answer: "We process withdrawals once per day, typically in the evening. After requesting withdrawal, you should receive your money within 2-6 hours. If you haven't received your payment by 8:00 PM (20:00) on the same day, please contact us immediately via WhatsApp at 0780079748 or through our contact page."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't receive my payment by 8:00 PM?",
      answer: "If you haven't received your MTN Mobile Money payment by 8:00 PM (20:00) on the day you requested withdrawal, there may be a technical issue. Contact us immediately via WhatsApp at 0780079748 or visit our contact page. Include your withdrawal request details and MTN number for faster resolution."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I end my membership?",
      answer: "We're sorry to see you go! You can delete your account by going to your Profile settings and selecting 'Delete Account'. Before leaving, please withdraw any remaining coin balance. If you're having issues, contact our support team - we're here to help improve your experience."
